# NLP-Book-Genre

This project was made to classify a book's genre based on its description. There are two notebooks in this repository
1. In Milestone2P2, a book is classified into Fiction or Nonfiction. Making this a binary classification project
2. In FinalProject, a book is classified into multiple genres. Making this a multi-label classification project
